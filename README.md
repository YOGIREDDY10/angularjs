# History of Angular
Angular is an open-source web framework for JavaScript applications. It's proven very popular, and was created in 2009 by two developers, Misko Hevery and Adam Abrons. The initial incarnation of Angular was GetAngular, which Hevery and Abrons designed to provide enterprise developers easy-to-build applications. Hevery was part of a Google team working on Google Feedback, and he grew increasingly frustrated with the immense amount of code, especially as testing and code modifications began. Hevery used GetAngular to rewrite Google Feedback, reducing the lines of code from 17,000 to 1,500. Clearly, that got Google's attention and development on GetAngular began in earnest. By the time, Abrons had stopped working on the original GetAngular project, Hevery and his manager, Brad Green, converted it into Angular, and Google built a team to create and support it. In 2012, Google released Angular version 1.0. To this day, Google continues to provide strong support and a cohesive community surrounding Angular.

# Angular is so popular because it:

Provides improved application design architecture
Promotes code reusability
Offers plug and play components
Consists of easy-to-remove components
Employs two-way data binding
Allows better teamwork
Because of Angular's ease of use, developers of all experience levels can quickly understand its functionality and how to easily find specific code components. 
# Angular contains the following core types of objects and components:

* Modules
* Controllers
* Services
* Directives.


These core components can be injected into each other using the Dependency Injection (DI) mechanism built into Angular. DI is a software design pattern that assigns dependencies to components instead of hard coding them within the component itself. You can divide your application into multiple types of components that Angular can inject into each other. You can create the components to be used in multiple applications without changing a single line of code, saving time and effort. Modularizing your application makes it easier to reuse, configure, and create easily testable components in your application.

Angular uses a feature called directives, allowing you to write HTML code, which then builds the HTML of your application instead of using templates to generate the user interface. The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, and text area) to application data. Utilizing two-way data binding, the values in your view are tightly bound to the data source. When a user interacts and updates a value, your model is updated dynamically as well.

When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model (DOM) of the page. Using the DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document. This allows Angular to dynamically edit the HTML and provide updates to the HTML without requiring a page load.

Since Angular is DOM-based, each component can be separated into separate files. Angular will then recompose these components into the DOM. You will find that there are less merge conflicts and, therefore, overall project progress becomes much easier to track.

Angular offers speed and flexibility, due to its component structure. Since it is modular, you can easily write and reuse the code, which is also testable. This means that Angular is an effective tool for building enterprise-wide applications across platforms.

In September 2014, Angular version 2.0 was announced at ng-Europe. This revision includes a complete rewrite of most core components of Angular in order to take advantage of the latest browser specifications. It is also written in Microsoft's TypeScript language, allowing for advanced language features and graceful degradation to older versions of ECMAScript. Angular version 2.0 was released to the public in September 2016.

This course will focus on Angular 1.5x due to the current market saturation of that version. Future versions of this course may feature Angular 2.x as adoption increases.
